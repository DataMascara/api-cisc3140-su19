    "--- In order to properly design the structure of the environment that our application will live on we first had to decide the applications requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support Python 3.6 --- Database team had designed module using strict 3.6 requirements\n",
    "* Run two applications --- One application for rendering Jinja templates and the other for serving the API data\n",
    "* Integrate CI support --- Having two applications required extreme precision when deploying code\n",
    "* Publicly available --- SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Ports forwarded\n",
    "* Git --- Ability to interact with GitHub repo\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Thinking through the solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. raspberry-pi\n",
    "    * Python 3.6 had to be installed and configured, this wasn't a huge deal but if done incorrectly could destroy our server.\n",
    "    * Running two applications was simple enough it only required us to select two seperate ports to run flask on, however due to the fact that the hardware was minimal flask ran very slow which then made our applications run slow. Our server had the following specs; 1 core, 512MB memory, and 64GB SD storage.\n",
    "    * Integrating CI support was there but not with technology we wanted to use causing us to have to learn something hence viable time most likely being wasted\n",
    "    * It was however easily made publicly available due to the fact that I was the network administrator so opening ports 80, 443, 22, and 23 were easy to do.\n",
    "    * GitHub support comes with the raspbian flavor of linux so this was no issue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Google App Engine\n",
    "    * Python 3.6 was not supported but some hacker-ish modifications could be made but this was not ideal at all\n",
    "    * Running two applications was simple, just set up two GAE projects\n",
    "    * CI Support with TravisCI available\n",
    "    * Publicly available once deployed to the cloud\n",
    "    * GitHub support came with the environment\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Heroku\n",
    "    * Python 3.6 support included\n",
    "    * Running two applications was simple, just set up two Heroku projects\n",
    "    * CI Support with TravisCI available\n",
    "    * Publicly available once deployed to Heroku environment\n",
